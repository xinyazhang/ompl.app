/**
\mainpage Introduction

The Open Motion Planning Library (\b OMPL) is a library of many state-of-the-art sampling-based motion planning algorithms. The library itself does not contain any code related to, e.g., collision checking or visualization. This is a deliberate design choice, so that OMPL is not tied to a particular collision checker or visualization front end. 

\b OMPL.app, the front-end for OMPL, contains a lightweight wrapper for the PQP collision checker and a simple GUI based on PyQt. The graphical front-end can be used for simple rigid body planning. It relies on the Assimp library to import a large variety of mesh formats that can be used to represent the robot and its environment.
