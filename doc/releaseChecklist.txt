Steps to release a new version:
* update release notes (releaseNotes.dox) and changelog.dox (date, features)
* hg pull -u in omplapp and ompl
* hg purge in omplapp and ompl
* build omplapp with bindings
* build ompl without bindings
* make test for both
* run ompl_app.py and solve a test problem
* make install
* make package_source
* upload to sourceforge.net:
    scp omplapp-0.9.3-Source.* ../omplRelease/ompl-0.9.3-Source.* mamoll,ompl@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/o/om/ompl
    (substitute your sourceforge userid for mamoll and change version number)
* make website for both omplapp and ompl (to update ompl-beta.kavrakilab.org)
* change "BRANCH=trunk" below to "BRANCH=release-x.y" (no patch level) and do make website for both omplapp and ompl. Undo these changes afterwards (do not commit)
* make sure the symlink /mnt/data2/ompl/release on arache points to the latest release-x.y (no patch level)
* tag omplapp and ompl with release-x.y.z (including patch level this time)
* update MacPorts port files (ask someone with a mac or file a ticket on trac.macports.org)
