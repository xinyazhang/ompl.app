Steps to release a new version:
* update release notes (releaseNotes.dox for both ompl and omplapp) and changelog (changelog.dox for ompl; put date, features)
* update version in ompl/CMakeModules/OMPLVersion.cmake
    - also increment ABI version if needed (if previously existing API has changed)
* hg pull -u in omplapp and ompl
* hg purge in omplapp and ompl
* build omplapp with bindings
* build ompl without bindings
* make test for both
* run ompl_app.py and solve a test problem
* make install
* make package_source
* upload to sourceforge.net:
    scp omplapp-0.9.3-Source.* ../omplRelease/ompl-0.9.3-Source.* mamoll,ompl@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/o/om/ompl
    (substitute your sourceforge userid for mamoll and change version number)
* make website for both omplapp and ompl (to update ompl-beta.kavrakilab.org)
* change "BRANCH=trunk" below to "BRANCH=release-x.y" (no patch level) and do make website for both omplapp and ompl. Undo these changes afterwards (do not commit)
* make sure the symlink /mnt/data2/ompl/release on arache points to the latest release-x.y (no patch level)
* tag omplapp and ompl with release-x.y.z (including patch level this time)
* update MacPorts port files (ask someone with a mac or file a ticket on trac.macports.org)
* push changes to the version of ompl on sourceforge (omplapp repo is private)
    - in the folder that contains the private clone of ompl, execute this command:
      hg push /path/to/local/clone/of/sourceforge/ompl -b default
      (this pushes the changes from the clone of the private version of ompl to the local clone of sourceforge, and only pushes the changes of the default branch)
    - cd /path/to/local/clone/of/sourceforge/ompl/
    - hg up
      (make sure everything is ok (hgview is a good tool to see what is in the repository))
    - hg push
      (pushes the changes to sourceforge)
* announce to ompl-users@lists.sourceforge.net
