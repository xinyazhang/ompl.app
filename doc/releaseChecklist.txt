Steps to release a new version:
* update release notes (releaseNotes.md for both ompl and omplapp; put date, features)
* update version in CMakeLists.txt, ompl/CMakeLists.txt
    - also increment ABI version if needed (if previously existing API has changed)
* "hg pull -u" in omplapp and ompl
* "hg purge --all" in omplapp and ompl
* build omplapp with bindings
* build ompl without bindings
* make test for both
* run ompl_app.py and solve a test problem
* make install
* make package_source
* upload to bitbucket.org
* make website for both omplapp and ompl to update web site repo (assumed to exist in ${HOME}/src/ompl.github.io)
* "jekyll build" in the ompl blog repo, copy content in _site/* to ${HOME}/src/ompl.github.io
* commit and push ${HOME}/src/ompl.github.io
* tag omplapp, ompl, ompl.github.io with version number x.y.z (including patch level this time)
* update MacPorts port files (ask someone with a mac or file a ticket on trac.macports.org) for ompl, fcl, libccd, flann, ode, castxml, py-pygccxml, py-pyplusplus and other possible dependencies.
* Update homebrew OMPL recipe (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/ompl.rb) and create a pull request.
* push changes to ompl and omplapp repos on bitbucket:
    - in the folders that contains the private clone of ompl, execute this command:
      hg push -b default ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/ompl/ompl
    - do the same for the omplapp repo
* update version on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMPL
* announce on ompl-users@lists.sourceforge.net, robot-motion@mit.edu
