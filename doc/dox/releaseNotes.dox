\page releaseNotes Release Notes

\section release_0_9_4 OMPL.app 0.9.4 (XXX, 2011)
- Renamed StateManifold to StateSpace and ControlManifold to ControlSpace
- Added RRTstar contribution
- Added GNAT nearest neighbors datastructure
- Added representation of a discrete state space (DiscreteStateSpace)
- Added representation of probability density functions (PDF)
- Replaced the implementation of BasicPRM with PRM. Thanks to James Marble, the new implementation uses BGL.
- Moved state propagation functionality from ControlSpace to a separate StatePropagator class
- Added SimpleSetup-derived classes for several control-based systems: kinematic car, Reeds-Shepp car, Dubins car, dynamic car, blimp, and quadrotor. Made them accessible through the GUI.
- Added isStraightLinePathValid() to PlannerDefinition
- Using boost ublas for real vector projections
- Add sanity checks for state spaces
- Benchmarked planners are now run in a separate thread (and termination conditions are evaluated separately, to detect crashes)
- Added getType() for Goal and replaced getType() for planners by getSpecs()
- Generalized planner termination conditions. The user can now call terminate() at any time to signal a planner it should stop its computation
- Improvements to control::KPIECE1, so that it considers goal biasing more appropriately
- Move code for extracting machine properties from util/ to benchmark/
- Documentation fixes

\section release_0_9_3 OMPL.app 0.9.3 (May 2, 2011)
- Added support for visualizing internal planner data
- Planning for 2D environments as well (SE2)
- Significant reorganization of code in OMPL.app
- Added path smoothing with splines
- Added a bi-directional implementation of KPIECE (BKPIECE)
- Support for computation of clearance and gradients that move away from invalid regions
- Separate "magic constants" to a separate, visible, location
- A number of bug fixes

\section release_0_9_2 OMPL.app 0.9.2 (February 21, 2011)
- Updates to operations on states: indexing in states can be done using state spaces or using integer values
- Bug fixes for planning with controls
- Minor doc improvements

\section release_0_9_1 OMPL.app 0.9.1 (December 17, 2010)
- Minor updates to build system

\section release_0_9_0 OMPL.app 0.9.0 (December 15, 2010; initial release)
- Implementations of many state-of-the-art sampling-based motion planning algorithms. For purely geometric planning, there are implementations of KPIECE, SBL, RRT, RRT Connect, EST, PRM, Lazy RRT, and others. For planning with differential constraints there are implementations of KPIECE and RRT. Addition of new planners poses very few constraints on the added code.
- A flexible mechanism for constructing arbitrarily complex configuration spaces and control spaces from simpler ones.
- A general method of defining goals: as states, as regions in configuration space, or implicitly.
- Various sampling strategies and an easy way to add other ones.
- Automatic selection of reasonable default parameters. Performance can be improved by tuning parameters, but solutions can be obtained without setting any parameters.
- GUI for rigid body motion planning.
- Support for planning with the Open Dynamics Engine, a popular physics simulator.
- Tools for systematic, large-scale benchmarking.
