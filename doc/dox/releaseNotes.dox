\page releaseNotes Release Notes

\section release_0_9_3 OMPL.app 0.9.3 (May 2, 2011)
- Added support for visualizing internal planner data
- Planning for 2D environments as well (SE2)
- Significant reorganization of code in OMPL.app
- Added path smoothing with splines
- Added a bi-directional implementation of KPIECE (BKPIECE)
- Support for computation of clearance and gradients that move away from invalid regions
- Separate "magic constants" to a separate, visible, location
- A number of bug fixes

\section release_0_9_2 OMPL.app 0.9.2 (February 21, 2011)
- Updates to operations on states: indexing in states can be done using state spaces or using integer values
- Bug fixes for planning with controls
- Minor doc improvements

\section release_0_9_1 OMPL.app 0.9.1 (December 17, 2010)
- Minor updates to build system

\section release_0_9_0 OMPL.app 0.9.0 (December 15, 2010; initial release)
- Implementations of many state-of-the-art sampling-based motion planning algorithms. For purely geometric planning, there are implementations of KPIECE, SBL, RRT, RRT Connect, EST, PRM, Lazy RRT, and others. For planning with differential constraints there are implementations of KPIECE and RRT. Addition of new planners poses very few constraints on the added code.
- A flexible mechanism for constructing arbitrarily complex configuration spaces and control spaces from simpler ones.
- A general method of defining goals: as states, as regions in configuration space, or implicitly.
- Various sampling strategies and an easy way to add other ones.
- Automatic selection of reasonable default parameters. Performance can be improved by tuning parameters, but solutions can be obtained without setting any parameters.
- GUI for rigid body motion planning.
- Support for planning with the Open Dynamics Engine, a popular physics simulator.
- Tools for systematic, large-scale benchmarking.
