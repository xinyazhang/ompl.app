# Installation

If you use Linux or OS X, then all dependencies can be installed either through a package manager or by OMPL's build system. In other words, you probably don't have to compile dependencies from source.

To compile OMPL and OMPL.app the following two packages are required:

- [Boost], version 1.54 or higher, and
- [CMake], version 2.8.7 or higher.

The build system includes a [number of options](buildOptions.html) that you can enable or disable. To be able to generate python bindings you need to install the [Python] library and header files.

Finally, to use the GUI the following dependencies are required (in addition to the ones above):

- [PyQt5], [PyQt4] or [PySide][] (which, in turn, require [Qt5]/[Qt4]) and
- [PyOpenGL].

Below are more detailed installation instructions for [Linux](#install_linux), [OS X](#install_osx), and [Windows](#install_windows).

\note If you are using [ROS], please see [MoveIt!][moveit].

# Installation on Linux {#install_linux}

## Ubuntu Linux

- Install Boost, CMake, and optional dependencies:

      sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev cmake libccd-dev python-dev python-qt4-dev python-qt4-gl python-opengl freeglut3-dev libassimp-dev libeigen3-dev libode-dev doxygen graphviz

- If the rendering in the OMPL.app GUI seems sluggish, you may want to install [PyOpenGL-accelerate](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyOpenGL-accelerate) to enable OpenGL hardware acceleration.
- If you want Python bindings or a GUI, [install Py++ and its dependencies](installPyPlusPlus.html).
- Create a build directory and run cmake:

      cd omplapp
      mkdir -p build/Release
      cd build/Release
      cmake ../..

- Optionally, generate the Python bindings with `make -j 4 update_bindings`.
- Compile OMPL.app by typing `make -j 4`.
- Optionally, run the test programs by typing `make test`.
- Optionally, generate documentation by typing `make doc`.
- If you need to install the library, you can type `sudo make install`. The install location is specified by `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. If you install in a non-standard location, you have to set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to the directory where the OMPL python module is installed (e.g., $HOME/lib/python2.7/site-packages).

## Fedora Linux

The installation instructions for Fedora Linux are mostly the same as for Ubuntu Linux, although the packages have slightly different names. On Fedora, you can install the dependencies like so:

      sudo yum install boost-devel cmake python-devel PyQt4 PyOpenGL assimp-devel mesa-libGL-devel libccd-devel assimp-devel eigen3 ode-devel doxygen graphviz

The build steps are the same as for Ubuntu Linux.


# Installation on Mac OS X {#install_osx}

It is easiest to install OMPL.app through [MacPorts], a package manager for OS X. However, if you feel adventurous, it is possible to install OMPL.app's dependencies with [HomeBrew](#install_homebrew) and compile OMPL.app yourself.


## MacPorts {#install_macports}

- Install [MacPorts].
- If you do not need to modify or see the source code of OMPL.app, then the easiest way to install OMPL.app is with the MacPorts `port` command:

      sudo port sync \; install ompl +app

  This is it. You are done. The GUI is invoked from the command line by `/opt/local/bin/ompl_app`. Demo programs and input files for the GUI can be found in `/opt/local/share/ompl`.
- If you downloaded the source distribution of OMPL.app, then you need to install the Boost, CMake, and optional dependencies. If you have MacPorts installed, type the following:

      sudo port sync
      sudo port install boost cmake assimp fcl ode py27-pyqt5 py27-opengl py27-pyplusplus eigen3 graphviz doxygen

- It is __very__ important that you use the same installed version of Python for all dependencies and OMPL.app. If you are using MacPorts, then you __must__ use the MacPorts version of python 2.7 (most likely installed in `/opt/local/bin`). To make this version the default python version, make sure `/opt/local/bin` appears before `/usr/bin` in your PATH. You can add a line like this to your `${HOME}/.bash_profile`:

      export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH

  Next, execute the following command:

      sudo port select python python27

- The build steps are the same as for Ubuntu Linux.


## Homebrew {#install_homebrew}

_Thanks to [Andrew Dobson](https://plus.google.com/104214233559576935970/about) for these instructions!_ __These instructions are somewhat experimental, however, and we have not tested them ourselves.__ Email us if you have suggestions to improve these instructions.

- Install [Homebrew].
- Run `brew doctor` to make sure that everything is ready to go.  If not, follow its instructions until it is ready.
- Type the following commands:

      easy_install pip
      brew install boost cmake assimp pyqt ode eigen doxygen graphviz
      pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL-accelerate

- The build steps are the same as for Ubuntu Linux.


# Installation on Windows {#install_windows}

\note It is possible to run OMPL and OMPL.app natively on Windows, although it must be stressed that __extensive testing on Windows is not performed__ at this time, and running OMPL.app on Windows is considered _highly_ experimental. It is _much_ easier to install [VirtualBox], create an Ubuntu virtual machine, and follow the Ubuntu installation directions above.

For best performance, the [MinGW] compiler is recommended. Visual Studio can also be used to build the core OMPL and OMPL.app libraries, but currently it is not possible to generate the python bindings for OMPL with this compiler. However, if the bindings are generated with MinGW, the bindings can be compiled by Visual Studio with some minor tweaks to the code (not recommended, unless you are an experienced Windows developer).


## Required Dependencies

- [CMake], version 2.8.7 or higher,
- [MinGW][] (recommended) or the Visual Studio compiler, and
- [Boost], version 1.54 or higher.

  It is recommended to make a complete Boost compilation from source. If using Visual Studio, this process can be automated using the [BoostPro](http://www.boostpro.com/download) installer. Once complete, set the environment variables `BOOST_ROOT` and `BOOST_LIBRARYDIR` to the locations where Boost and its libraries are installed. The default locations are `C:\\Boost` and `C:\\Boost\\lib`. Ensure that `BOOST_LIBRARYDIR` is also in the system PATH so that any necessary Boost dlls are loaded properly at runtime.

- [Assimp](http://assimp.sourceforge.net) If not already installed, the last release (version 2.0) is downloaded and compiled automatically via CMake. If using Visual Studio 2010, this version will __NOT__ compile. It is recommended to checkout Assimp from their svn repository and install assimp.lib/dll manually if using VS2010. Ensure that Assimp is installed and that the include and lib directories are in the system PATH.


## Optional Dependencies (for Python bindings and OMPL.app GUI)

- A __32-bit__ version of [Python] 2.7.  Ensure that this is installed __before building Boost__ so that Boost.Python is properly compiled.
- Ensure that Python is added to the system `PATH`.
- Py++: To generate the Python bindings, Py++ and its dependencies must be installed. Instructions can be found [here](installPyPlusPlus.html).
- [PyQt5] (or [PyQt4]) and [PyOpenGL] must be installed to run the OMPL.app gui.
- [pkg-config](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/dependencies/) must be installed for the collision checking library (FCL).


## Build
- Once the dependencies are installed, CMake can be used to generate MinGW makefiles or a Visual Studio solution by specifying a specific GENERATOR:

      cd omplapp
      mkdir build
      cd build
      mkdir Release
      cd Release
      cmake -G "GENERATOR" ../.. [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install]

The CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable is set to `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\omplapp` by default.


### MinGW

- The CMake generator for MinGW is `"MinGW Makefiles"`
- To generate the python bindings (optional), execute the update_bindings make command before compiling:

      mingw32-make update_bindings

  __Note:__ `update_bindings` is _never_ run automatically. If you change any of the OMPL header files, you need to regenerate the bindings for the changes to be reflected in the Python modules. See also the [more detailed documentation on generating python bindings](\ref updating_python_bindings).
- Use `mingw32-make` to build OMPL and OMPL.app.
- If you wish to install OMPL and OMPL.app, use the install command to copy the binaries, demo code, and other resources to the cmake install prefix.  Note that you will need to be in a shell with administrator privileges to install to the default directory.

      mingw32-make install

- Make sure to add the install path's \\lib subdirectory to the PATH so that the DLLs are found when code is loaded.


### Visual Studio

- The CMake generator for Visual Studio depends on the version of Visual Studio to generate a solution for. The generator for VS 2010 is `"Visual Studio 10"`, and the generator for VS 2008 is `"Visual Studio 9 2008"`. Consult the CMake documentation for other generators.
- Open omplapp.sln and build the solution.  Two static libraries will be created (ompl.lib and ompl_app.lib) to link your code against, as well as several demo programs.
- You can install OMPL and OMPL.app by building the "INSTALL" project inside of the solution.  Note that this will attempt to copy files to `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\omplapp` (the default).  The installation will fail unless Visual Studio is opened with administrator privileges, or a non-system install prefix is specified when cmake is run.
