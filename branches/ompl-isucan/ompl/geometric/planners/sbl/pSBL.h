	   @anchor gpSBL
	   
	   @par Short description
	   
	   SBL is a tree-based motion planner that attempts to grow two
	   trees at once: one grows from the starting state and the other
	   from the goal state. Attempts are made to connect these trees
	   at every step of the expansion. If they are connected, a
	   solution path is obtained. However, this solution path is not
	   certain to be valid (the lazy part of the algorithm) so it is
	   checked for validity. If invalid parts are found, they are
	   removed from the tree and exploration of the state space
	   continues until a solution is found. 
	   
	   To guide the exploration, and additional grid data structure is
	   maintained. Grid cells contain states that have been previously
	   visited. When deciding which state to use for further
	   expansion, this grid is used and least filled grid cells have
	   most chances of being selected. The grid is usually imposed on
	   a projection of the state space. This projection needs to be
	   set before using the planner.
