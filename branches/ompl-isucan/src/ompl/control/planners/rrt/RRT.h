	   @par Short description
	   
	   The basic idea of RRT is that it samples a random state @b qr
	   in the state space, then finds the state @b qc among the
	   previously seen states that is closest to @b qr and expands
	   from @b qc towards @b qr, until a state @b qm is reached and @b
	   qm is the new state to be visited.
