	   @anchor gLazyRRT
	   
	   @par Short description
	   
	   The basic idea of RRT is that it samples a random state @b qr
	   in the state space, then finds the state @b qc among the
	   previously seen states that is closest to @b qr and expands
	   from @b qc towards @b qr, until a state @b qm is reached and @b
	   qm is the new state to be visited. The difference between RRT
	   and LazyRRT is that when moving towards the new state @b qm,
	   LazyRRT does not check to make sure the path is valid. Instead,
	   it is optimistic and attempts to find a path as soon as
	   possible. Once a path is found, it is checked for collision. If
	   collisions are found, the invalid path segments are removed and
	   the search process is continued.
