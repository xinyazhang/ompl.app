	   @anchor kLazyRRT
	   
	   @par Short description
	   
	   The basic idea of RRT is that it samples a random state @b qr
	   in the state space, then finds the state @b qc among the
	   previously seen states that is closest to @b qr and expands
	   from @b qc towards @b qr, until a state @b qm is reached and @b
	   qm is the new state to be visited. The difference between RRT
	   and LazyRRT is that when moving towards the new state @b qm,
	   LazyRRT does not check to make sure the path is valid. Instead,
	   it is optimistic and attempts to find a path as soon as
	   possible. Once a path is found, it is checked for collision. If
	   collisions are found, the invalid path segments are removed and
	   the search process is continued.

		state qr in the state space, then finds the state qc
		among the previously seen states that is closest to qr
		and expands from qc towards qr, until a state qm is
		reached and qm is the new state to be visited. The
		range parameter influences how this qm along the path
		between qc and qr is chosen. qr may be too far, and it
		may not be best to have qm = qr all the time (range =
		1.0 implies qm=qr. range should be less than
		1.0). However, in a large space, it is also good to
		leave the neighborhood of qc (range = 0.0 implies
		qm=qc and no progress is made. rande should be larger
		than 0.0). Multiple values of this range parameter
		should be tried until a suitable one is found. */
